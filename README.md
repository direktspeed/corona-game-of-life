# corona-game-of-life
Corona Game Of Life is a Conway Game Of Life like Simulation with small inputs it is made to Visualize the Corona Pandemic effect

## Expected Result
It should clear demonstrate that the current Government Advices are simply none productive and make no sense overall. The only Result that we can expect from the StayHome Movement is that we create Mega Viruses and kill People.


# Input Parameters
- Total Population
- Death Rate Prev Year
- Reproduction R Infection limit 
- Time to Immun (If we do not get Immun Scenario as Bonus)

# The Inital Rules they need rework and experiments
a cell can represent up to x persons
- 4 weeks is the maximum Infection Time of a person
- 1 person infects up to 10 persons while Infected
- 1 person that is infected gets immun after 4 weeks 2 weeks for incubating and 2 weeks for regeneration
- 1 person can not Die because of Covid 19 so we apply the normal Death Rate from the prev year.
- The Game Ends after 6 Month
- After end a Mutated version of this comes up and it restarts with a secund color cells that never got hit in the first iteration will be able to get infected again this time with both viruses



# Additional Parameters and Considerations
- Is a person that is immun infecting new people and does it get infected again
  - the current indication of the RKI is that this will not happen as they advice to put immun people on risk persons
